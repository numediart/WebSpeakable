# WebSpeakable

## Wait... What is it?
WebSpeakable is a Tampermonkey script that speaks the selected text on web pages using installed Microsoft voice on Windows, or Google voices on Chrome web browser.  To use it, first select any text on the page (except inside an iframe) and press 'p' key.
It is also possible to declare some part of the HTML code, including inside iframe, to be "speakable" when there is mouse interaction (click or mouse hover).
